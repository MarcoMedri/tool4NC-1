# tool4nc

Python module containing functions for simplifing the netCDF files manipulations.


## Dependencies:

In the setup.py it is possible have a look to all the dependencies required and they are listed below:

- [x] netCDF4>=1.4.2
- [x] csv342>=1.0.0 
- [x] pandas>=0.23.4

## Be aware that:

The tool is in development so it can be possible find bugs, errors and imprecisions. Please to report them if you find one. 

   
## Installation:

To use this software is suggested the creation of a python environment (python ~=3.6). It becames mandatory if your python version is part of the 2.* family. Following few basic instructions (if interesed) to install the module in a new ad-hoc environment.


### Procedure for the Anaconda python distribution:

- conda update conda (To update the Anaconda distribution)

- conda create -n {your_env_name} python=3.6 (For the creation of a python environment)

- conda list (List all the environments installed)

- conda activate {your_env_name} (Activate the chosen environment)

- conda activate (Come back to the initial environment)


### Procedure for the standard python distribution:

- pip install pipenv (installation of the package needed)

- create project folder 

- pipenv pipenv --python 3.6 (Install the python environment inside the project folder)


### tool4nc installation using:

- pip install tool4nc: 

For Anaconda users and the command can be executed from every path locations. 
 
- pipenv install tool4nc:

For python standard distribution users. The command needs to be run inside the project folder.


## Functions included:


### nctocsv ("path_input file", "path_output folder")

This function converts a netCDF file to a csv file. It will generate two csv files called file.csv and file_cleaned.csv respectively. The file_cleaned.csv is cleaned by all the NAN values and it is considered the final output file of this function.


### nctoshape ("path_input file", "path_output folder", "variable_name")

This function converts a netCDF file into a shape file (Point features). Firstly, it will generate two csv files called file.csv and file_cleaned.csv respectively. After that, the file_cleaned.csv (purified by all the NAN values) is used to extract the corresponding shapefile representing a variable’s values which is the third argument of this function.


### concatnc ("path_input folder")

This function can concatenate segments of data coming from the same dataset but at different time steps. It will generate a file called “concatenated.nc” as result. The only argument needed is the folder where the files are located.


### splitnc ("path_input file",  "path_output folder", "type", "suffix")

This function can split the data by type; DAY (DD), MONTH (YYYYMM) and YEAR (YYYY). It gives the option to add a suffix to the generated data. 


## Case examples:


### I have many netCDF files and I would like to convert all of them in CSV: 

```
import os
from tool4nc import nctocsv

Input_DIR = 'the/directory/you/want/to/use'
Out_DIR = 'the/directory/you/want/to/use'

for filename in os.listdir(Input_DIR):
    if filename.endswith(".nc"):
       nctocsv (filename, Out_DIR)

```

### I want to overlay in my GIS project (as shape-file) data from a variable which is contained in my netCDF file:

```
import os
from tool4nc import nctoshape

Input_DIR = 'the/directory/you/want/to/use'
Out_DIR = 'the/directory/you/want/to/use'
Variable = ‘Variable name’

for filename in os.listdir(Input_DIR):
    if filename.endswith(".nc"):
       nctoshape (filename, Out_DIR, Variable)

```

### I have a folder with a month of data divided in daily files. These files are downloaded from the same dataset and I would like to concatenate all the daily files in a montly one:

```
from tool4nc import concatnc, plotintime

Input_DIR = 'the/directory/where/you/store/the/daily/file'

concatnc (Input_DIR) #it will generate the concatenated.nc file

```

### I have one year file but i realised that it is better have the data organised by Month. Furthermore, I would like also add a suffix to each file:

```
from tool4nc import slitnc

Input_file = 'the/path/of/your/input/file'
Out_DIR = 'the/directory/you/want/to/output/the/results'
type = "MONTH"
suffix = "text/to/append/at/each/file"


splitnc (Input_file, Out_DIR, type, suffix)

```
